# FOLLOW-UP PROMPT (Based on RGCOA Continuation)

role: 
  # Same or updated role depending on next step 
  # e.g. senior-developer, reviewer, mentor

task: 
  # Refine, debug, extend, verify, or simplify previous output
  # e.g. "Refine the previous code to improve testability and performance"

context:
  - previous-output-summary: 
      # Summarize or paste key result from the last run
      # Optionally: specify what part you’re following up on
  - refinement-goal: 
      # What do you want improved/checked? (clarity, accuracy, nuance, structure)
  - limit-context: 
      # Keep or remove unrelated parts from last context
  - use-tools: 
      # Optional: tools to verify or test output (context7, search, etc.)
  - ask-for:
      # Ask model to clarify what was assumed, skipped, or generalized
      # e.g. "List any assumptions made in your last response"

output:
  # Format for refined result (table, diff, updated mermaid, simplified code, etc.)

agency:
  # augmentation: collaborate to improve or fix last result
  # automation: apply deterministic refinements (no rethinking entire thing)

self-verification:
  # Verify improvements or correctness — e.g. lint, compile, test, compare
  # Ask model to show reasoning for changes ("why was this change needed?")

after-completion:
  - Teach me what improved and why it matters
  - Show the before/after difference clearly
  - If code: explain what pattern or anti-pattern was fixed

before-starting:
  - "Summarize what you understood from previous response."
  - "Ask me to confirm or add details before making refinements."
