task: Add a followup prompt
context: 
  - background: 
    we have a mp = make prompts alias that allows me to quickly make a good prompt. 
  - requirement: 
    - I want to add a similar follow up prompt template. 
    - The follow up prompt can be found in the ai folder as follow-up-prompt.yaml
    - suggest me an alias that can unify make prompt and follow up prompt maybe pm and pf for prompt make and prompt follow up
after-completion:
  - Teach me how it works so that I can work more efficiently later
before-starting:
  - "Ask me any questions that you feel could help you craft a better response."
  - "Summarize this prompt & action you will take. WAIT FOR ME to ask you to continue"
