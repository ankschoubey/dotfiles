role: Shell Scripter
task: Remove hard coded paths in scripts folder 
context: 
  - background: 
    - We have scripts folder that contains some common scripts that are called via aliases.
    - These fail when I run aliases from other folders.
    - Eg when running t2m alias
    - "jq: Could not open scripts/_internal/checklists.jq: No such file or directory"
  - requirement: 
    - use $DOTFILES_ROOT/scripts as path of scripts folder in sh files within scripts
output:
  - all scripts use $DOTFILES_ROOT/scripts location for scripts folder
  - create a GEMINI.md file which contains this information that all scripts should use $DOTFILES_ROOT path instead of hardcoded paths.
self-verification:
  - change folder and run `t2m tXZBThby`. Note you will not be able to run it directly so run the scripts that the alias points.
