    - add a new alias t2m which runs trello to markdown
    - it should run the same t2f command

  - new alias t2m which calls existing t2f alias
  - new trello-to-markdown.sh script

  - alias should be similar to existing t2d alias i.e only call t2f and script folder.
  - format should be same as import-to-dayone.sh
