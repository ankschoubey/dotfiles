role: shell-scripter 
task: fix sketchybar and aerospace connection on load 
context: 
  - background: 
    - restartAerospace function restart aerospace and sketchybar
    - when this happens, sketchybar is often unaware of open aerospace tabs.
    - eg - currently I have 2 apps open on workspace 4 which is on my wide screen monitor. sketchybar does not reflect the open apps on workspace 4 after restart.
  - requirement:
    - fix communication between sketchybar and aerospace so that even after restart sketchybar has all the things filled
    - nuance - on startup of aerospace you may need to pass info to sketchybar or maybe sketchybar has to pass info to aerospace. however it is please fix.
output: 
  - fixed aerospace, sketchybar configuration
self-verification: 
  - idk how to suggest you to self verify. suggest me what good self verification can be here.
after-completion:
  - Teach me how you fixed it and give some insights about aerospace & sketchybar on the script level.
before-starting:
  - "Ask me any questions that you feel could help you craft a better response."
  - "Summarize this prompt & action you will take. WAIT FOR ME to ask you to continue"
