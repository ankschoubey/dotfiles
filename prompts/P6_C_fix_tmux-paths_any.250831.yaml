task: fix tmux config 
context: 
  - background: 
    - I have created some symlinks for tmux but I think they are wrong.
    - when I run the following command I get error
    - "tmux source ~/.tmux.conf" - "/Users/ankushchoubey/.tmux.conf: Too many levels of symbolic links"
  - requirement:
    - fix the symlinks error and ensure tmux is able to load up config.
output:
  - fixed config.  
self-verification:
  - running tmux source command should not error
after-completion:
  - Teach me how you fixed so that I can do it myself later if needed.
before-starting:
  - "Ask me any questions that you feel could help you craft a better response."
  - "Summarize this prompt & action you will take. WAIT FOR ME to ask you to continue"
